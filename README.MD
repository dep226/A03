PART 1 
Create a tutorial on how to use GitHub

First and foremost, this tutorial should fairly get you familiar with how to use Webstorm and Github together.
Honestly, i used office hours for assingment because i had some trouble getting started. I utilized the professors office hours and i'm glad i did because
it was worth it. I actually learned how to utilize Webstorm and hoe to commit and push through Webstorm.

Alright now that my intro is set, I'll explain what github, webstorm and Git is. 
Think of it like a peanut butter sandwitch. You have the bread, the jelly, and the peanut butter.
They all go together and ironically taste amazing together. Its a simple analogy but it works exactly the same.

Okay first and foremost, i will be doing the Mac version installation and tutorial only, 
since i'm using a macBook Air afterall. You have to download the applications Webstorm, Git, and create an account
on Github.com. The link i use is at bottom of this tutorial and its the Git installation which uses webstorm.
I then click download for Mac, it then leads me to 6 other options to download. You only have to choose 1 from these 6 plug-ins.
I chose Homebrew, you copy the terminal commands, 'brew install git' copy paste that to your terminal on mac then wait for the installation to begin.
Once you have Git and Webstorm installed, you open up Webstorm and start up the set up for Webstorm. Now download Webstorm from the website
given below of this tutorial, hit For students and teachers, put your information, and college email to get a free license package deal. 
When you check your email, it should give you a link to the website, follow that link and install Webstorm on your desktop. Now all you need is to create a 
Github account, the link is given below, just put your info and college email and you should have your link to your github account set up.

Now that we have Webstorm, Git, and Github ready we can do the following steps to set them up.
In reality we need to set up github and webstorm only. So heres the process for each one:
Now you need to set up a repository for Github: simply the do the following: click the + sign top right corner above, click create 'new repository'.
Make the repository public and add the 'readme file'. Now Select VCS and import into Version Control. Now you're importing a repository from Github.
From Main page Select Checkout from version control, then Git or from within Webstorm Select VCS, Checkout from version control, Git  Enter Github repository name.
Start up Webstorm, click version control, Git, click test to make sure Webstorm is connected to Git. Click Create New Project on the Webstorm main page.
Choose a location and give the project name. Click create, create new File, Put a Title on that folder, Click VCS then import into Version Control, Create Git Repository. 
Click OK then just commit the changes to GIT, click commit. Now add the project to Github, click VCS, import to version control, share project on Github, click share.
You should get a message saying successfully shared project on Github. Add new file to thr Github Repository, create New File, name it README.MD then simply just commit.
Now just make some changes in Webstorm, commit to Git, VCS, Git, then commit, add the commit comment and click commit. Push the change to Github. You should see a revised index.html file on Github.
In a nutshell thats basically all you're really doing for Github and Webstorm, since Git is an actual application that makes changes into webstorm, all you're really doing is working with Webstorm the entire time and pushing and commiting int
Github. This wraps up part One for Creating a tutorial using Git, Github, and Webstorm. Thank you!

Part 2

- __branch__: the git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches*

- __Clone__: git clone is primarily used to point an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo in a new directory, at another location.

- __Commit__: commits is an operation which sends the latest changes of the source code to the repository.

- __Fetch__: Fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. Its used in conjuction with git remote, git branch, git checkout, git reset to update a local repository to the state of a remote.

- __GIT__: Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files.

- __Github__: Github is an internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git.

- __Merge__: merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.

- __Merge Conflict__: merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

- __Push__: the git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

- __Pull__: the git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repostiory to match that content.

- __Remote__: the git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories.

- __Repository__: a git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project.
